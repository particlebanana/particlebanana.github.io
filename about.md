I'm Cody Stoltman, known 'round these parts as **particlebanana**. I'm a developer and co-founder of [treeline](https://treeline.io) and a core member of the [sails](http://sailsjs.org) and [waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) projects.

I build cool things in Node and share them with people on [GitHub](https://github.com/particlebanana).

I enjoy *short* walks on the beach, the lyrical stylings of [Rick Ross](http://thedrop.fm/files/2013/05/RickRoss_RickDiamond.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89), and cats.
